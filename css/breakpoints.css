/* To activate the outdent breakpoint choose a width suitable to 
your site design. E.g. for a centered layout with a regular center content width
(--rg-width) an --outdent-breakpoint could be set to a value of --rg-breakpoint.
The initial setting of 9999px for --outdent-breakpoint deactivates outdenting of 
list elements (ul, ol), timelines (dl.timeline), and summaries (detail>summary)*/

/*The --outdent-outline-breakpoint works similar to the --outdent-breakpoint
except it is only for outlining numbered heading elements like h2, h3, …. Heading elements
that are enclosed in an .outline class will be outdented when this breakpoint
is fulfilled. Because the outline numbers of headings might take more space the 
--outdent-outline-breakpoint will typically be wider than the --outdent-breakpoint! 
It is also possible to activate only one of the two --outdent… breakpoints*/
